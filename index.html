                    <p>After a good stretch at Marquette Group, I got the opportunity to move into a new position at Maritz, a large company with a great reputation in the St. Louis area, as a business analyst in 2017. After about a year and a half, I got another opportunity to become a Product Owner in the IT/Engineering department on an Agile team. I am currently working in this position today.</p>

                    <p>In winter of 2019, I was accepted and began the Launchcode journey. As for future career goals and what's next after this course, I hope to continue to grow with my current career and use my skillset from LC101 to perhaps work closer with or as a developer or move into a TPM role. I am excited for the future!</p>
